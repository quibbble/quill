## Objective 🎯

Play cards and control the battlefield to defeat your opponent.

## Components 🧱

- 2 30 card decks (1 per team)
- 6 base cards (3 per team)
- A 7x3 game board
- 2 mana pools (1 per team)

## Setting Up 🏗️
- Place each team's base cards at either end of the board
- Suffle each deck and each player draws 5 cards from their deck.

## How to Play 🚀
What to do on your turn:

1. **Draw a Card:** Take a card from the top of your deck and place it in your hand.

2. **Sack a Card:** You may sacrifice a card and place it in your discard once per turn. Then choose to gain +1 base mana or draw 2 cards.

3. **Play Cards:** You may play any card in your hand that costs less than or equal to your current mana pool. On play subtract the cost from your mana pool.

4. **Move Units:** Units with movement stat greater than 0 may move one tile. This stat is decremented by 1 on move.

5. **Attack Units:** Units with cooldown stat equal to 0 may attack another unit. This stat is reset to base cooldown on attack.

6. **End Turn:** On turn end, team's mana pool is set to base mana, all units owned by the team have cooldown decremented by 1, and all units owned by team have movement reset to base movement.

## How to Win 🏆

To win you must destroy 2/3 of your opponent's bases while protecting your own.
